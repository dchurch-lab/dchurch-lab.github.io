Welcome to the Church group's notes website. Yes, that's right, the website describing the research in the group is located on the [Wellcome Center for Human Genetics server](https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/research/research-groups/church-group). 

Here, you can find the code and resources we share within the group. With time, hopefully, this website will grow in content. 

# Notebooks

## Plots

On this list, you can find links to short notebooks with code describing the examples of plots in each "genre". Enjoy!
